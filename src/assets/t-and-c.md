# Terms and Conditions for Block and Jerry's.

## Technology
Although the products we are selling here are real, this store is for testing and demonstration purposes only. The Lightning Network Daemon, which Block and Jerry's uses to generate and accept transactions, is still very new and contains known and unknown bugs. Additionally, the Lightning Labs is neither affiliated nor supports the existence of this store.

## Ice Cream
There is no guarantee your ice cream will be icey or frozen by the time it reaches you. The delivery specialists only have skateboards and bikes.

## Payment
All payments are due upon receipt. If a payment is not received or payment method is declined, the buyer forfeits the ownership of any items purchased. If no payment is received, no items will be shipped.

## Shipping Policies
There are no shipping policies, because no items will be shipped.

## Refund/Return Policy
Items are entitled to be refunded or returned based on complaint. If an item is unsatisfactory, a written explanation is needed before the item may be considered for a refund. Buyer must take into account the description of the item before requesting a refund. If the item matches the description by the seller and the buyer is unsatisfied, the seller is not responsible for refund. Exchanges are granted on a case-by-case basis.

## Cancellation
An item may be cancelled up until payment has been processed. Once payment has been processed, the buyer is responsible for payment.

## Complaints
Any complaints about items or sellers may be sent to our support team: XXX EMAIL or PHONE XXX. There is no guarantee of a resolution. Each case will be looked at individually, and the seller will be in contact as well.

## Legalities
The seller is not responsible for any health or safety concerns once the buyer has received the item. If any harm is incurred from the items purchased by the buyer, the seller shares no responsibility.

These terms and conditions are subject to change.

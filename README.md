# Block and Jerry's

Motivated by [Starblocks](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/), I wanted to offer the world a desert to compliment their testnet coffee. Using Lighting Lab's [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) as my gateway to the Lightning Network, I built a React front end to generate invoices for ice cream on top of my LND node. 

## How to Run

```
git clone https://github.com/robertDurst/blockandjerrys.git
cd blockandjerrys
npm install
npm run server // middleware server in terminal A
npm start // front end in terminal B
```
